## To run
Needs a file `data.json` with the following format
```
{
"<data>": <a json array of arrays of points>
...
}
```

each `array of points` is a sample generated by the *drawer* tool.

presently it tries to predict if the input is an "A" or a "B". If an "A" is seen, it will return a 0 and if "B" is seen  it will return a 1.
